![Cardstock Color List](/img/cardstock_color_list2.png "Choosing the right cardstock")

It is required to print tags on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pastel colored cardstock</span>. Dark colors cause difficulty with scanning at check-out. Please use the appropriate color cardstock for your items. This allows us to easily identify your items and speeds up the sorting process at the end of the sale.

ALL WHITE CARDSTOCK TAGGED ITEMS will be donated at sale end unsorted â€“ without exception. Consignors will not have access to items allocated for donation. [Donating](http://www.boutiqueforaweek.net/consignors/donating-unsold-items/) helps the community and saves time sorting. Take additional care to ensure your cardstock matches the colors listed and is not easily mistaken for white. In recent sales, too light pink and yellow cardstock have been added to the donation pile due to being indistinguishable from white.

All Cardstock featured is available in 65 or 67 lb. weights.

Cardstock is sold at various big box stores, office supply stores, or on Amazon.com.
