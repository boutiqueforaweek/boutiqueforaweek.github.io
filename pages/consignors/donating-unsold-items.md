Boutique For A Week makes huge contributions at the end of our sale because of our Consignors' generosity. Each sale we donate thousands of items to local charities to benefit those in crisis in our community. Please choose to donate your unsold items! It makes a difference in someone's life!

Keep in mind that any items you tag with WHITE cardstock will be donated if they remain unsold at sale end. Additionally, all items not picked up during designated [Pick Up]({% link pages/consignors/picking-up.md %}) hours are donated. No exception. If you know you want to donate your items, use white cardstock. It saves us tons of sorting time!

Note: Any item you intend to donate should be designated for the 50% off sale as well.

If you decide during the sale to donate your unsold items, please [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}subject=I%20want%20to%20donate%20unsold%20items) so we know to put your items in the donation area. This will save us the time of sorting your items and bless families in our community, which we appreciate!

If an itemized list of donated items are needed, please be sure to download/print your unsold items report immediately after the sale. The sales software we utilize does not keep records of unsold item reports, nor do we.
