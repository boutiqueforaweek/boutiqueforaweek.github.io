Valet Tagging is available to those who want to consign and earn a little extra money, but can’t seem to find the time to tag their items.  This service is available on a first come, first serve basis.

You will be required to drop off your items along with hangers, ziploc bags, card stock in the [appropriate color]({% link pages/consignors/cardstock-color-list.md %}), zip ties, safety pins, etc. A Volunteer will enter all the tagging information and set the prices. Then the Volunteer will tag your items and deliver them to [Drop Off.]({% link pages/consignors/dropping-off.md %})

You earn 40% of your selling price if you choose this option. Other restrictions and deadlines apply, please [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you are interested in Valet Tagging.
