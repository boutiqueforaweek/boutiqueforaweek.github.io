Consignors keep 65% of the selling price of each item!

A $10 fee is charged during the registration process, paid through Paypal. This fee is non-refundable.

Checks of Consignor earnings are available at [Pick Up]({% link pages/consignors/picking-up.md %}) unless we experience the unlikely event of equipment failure. We make every effort to have them ready for you! We will email all Consignors ONLY IF checks will NOT be available at Pick Up.

If you are planning to donate all of your unsold items to charity, but would like to come during Pick Up to receive your sale earnings, we encourage you to do so! Pick Up for our Fall 2021 Sale is Saturday, September 18th from 10:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m.

Any checks not picked up onsite will be mailed to you immediately following the sale. Please contact us only if you have not received your check three weeks from the Pick Up date.
