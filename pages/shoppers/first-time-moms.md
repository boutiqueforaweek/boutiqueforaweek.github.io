Pregnant moms, moms with children under the age of 1, and foster or adopting moms may register to shop early by clicking [HERE](http://www.mysalemanager.net/mom_start.aspx?partnercode=BFAW).

We have a large selection of gently used childrenâ€™s clothing, port-a-cribs, swings, cribs, etc. all at greatly reduced prices and all available to YOU before we open to the public. **Our {{ site.data.sale.season }} New and Expecting Moms Pre-Sale is Tuesday, {{ site.data.sale.presale }} from 4:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m.**

Once you are registered, you will receive an email confirmation with a shopping pass. Print your pass and bring it with you to the sale. This allows you to enter the Pre-Sale without waiting in line to register at the door.

If registration is closed, come anyway and register at the sale! Spread the word to your new friends in your childbirth classes. You are welcome to bring your spouse, parents, and grandparents along to help you shop! However, this time is set aside for New/Expecting Moms so your friends will be unable to join you at this time.

*Please note, infants in a stroller or car seat carrier are welcome to come, but because this is our busiest time with 300+ shoppers, we ask that you please make other arrangements for additional children.
