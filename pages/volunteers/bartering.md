## Non-Traditional Volunteer Opportunities

Have a unique service to offer or a product we might need? &nbsp;Often non-traditional venues bless us more than you can imagine! Below please find a list of our specific needs.

## Cooperative Advertising

If you have a website or publication and allow Boutique For A Week to place a banner ad on your site or print ad in your publication, we will allow you to place an ad on our site or will exchange for volunteer hours.

## Sorting at end of the sale

If you can organize a group of teenage students who might need community service hours to come and sort unsold clothing items, then you will earn hours toward volunteer Pre-Sale privileges. We also happily sign any volunteer paperwork for the service hours completed at our event.

## TV/Radio coverage

Arrange for news coverage with someone who reports at one of the major news or radio stations and get Boutique For A Week interviewed.

## Magazine/Newspaper coverage

Arrange for news coverage with an area or regional magazine or newspaper and get editorial coverage for our event.

## Gift Cards

Provide us with a $25 gift card. Since our supply needs vary from sale to sale, <a href="mailto:info@boutiqueforaweek.com">email</a> Boutique For A Week&nbsp;for the specific stores allowed.

## Meals: Are you a fabulous cook? We need to eat!

If you are interested in volunteering in this way, please <a href="mailto:info@boutiqueforaweek.com">email us</a> for more information!
