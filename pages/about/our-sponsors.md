  - company: Whatever is Pure

    details: "Whatever Is Pure, LLC is a home bakery in Lake Mary making delicious organic chemical-free breads and skin care products. Everything is made to order. Bread can be healthy and nutritious! I mill the flour at home so there are no chemicals involved and all the nutrients are preserved. Wheat naturally has a lot of fiber, protein and B-complex vitamins but they are lost in the process of making flour in factories. Skin care should be helping your skin, not destroying it. I battled eczema and skin allergies for years. My lotion, deodorant, laundry soap and lip balm soothe skin, heal small cuts and (along with an anti-inflammatory and chemical free diet) took away the eczema."

    details: "Ashleigh & Victoria are the proud mother daughter boutique business owners of LuLaRoe by Ash & Tori. We offer a wide range of sizes from XXS-3XL for women and sizes 2-12 for kids and we carry styles that ladies of all shapes, sizes, and ages can love. One of our greatest passions is working as personal stylists—helping women feel beautiful in their own skin and confident in what they wear. Over 9 years, we have built strong relationships with our community by focusing on quality, affordability, and personalized service. Fashion is more than just clothing—it's about expression, empowerment, and feeling good from the inside out, and our goal has always been to make that experience accessible to every woman who walks into our boutique. We carry tops, dresses, kimonos, cardigans, shorts, skorts, dress pants, a fitness collection, buttery soft leggings, and more. We host monthly Open Houses, offer private in-person shopping appointments to try on LuLaRoe, and we ship across the United States. We would be honored to meet you and help you find styles you love!"

      Hi! I’m Becca. Certified Personal Trainer. Nutrition Coach. 90+ lb lost. Coach for women ready to feel strong again.
      I was 262 lbs, exhausted, overwhelmed, and hiding from every mirror & public activity.
      I had no energy to say yes to my kids, no confidence in myself — and no idea how to start.
      But I borrowed someone else’s belief in me... until I found my own.
      Today, I’m a Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach with a thriving garage gym right here in Casselberry (literal dream come true!), and I’ve helped dozens of women ditch the all-or-nothing thinking and finally find what works.
      I created Be Well Coaching to give women the kind of support I wish I had — not just accountability, but compassion, honesty, and a real relationship.
