    details: "Hello! My name is Diana. I am a stay-at-home mom of 6. Crafting is my passion I love to create new things. It first started off with crocheting. When my babies were smaller I would make them blankets. I even made small hats when my baby girl was a preemie in the hospital. As my little girl's got older I got into making them bows. I really enjoyed making them look really cute and matching with outfits for school. If you can think it, we can create it!"
