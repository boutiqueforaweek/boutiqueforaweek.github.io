  - company: Whatever is Pure

    link: "https://www.whateverispure.net/"
    details: "Whatever Is Pure, LLC is a home bakery in Lake Mary making delicious organic chemical-free breads and skin care products. Everything is made to order. Bread can be healthy and nutritious! I mill the flour at home so there are no chemicals involved and all the nutrients are preserved. Wheat naturally has a lot of fiber, protein and B-complex vitamins but they are lost in the process of making flour in factories. Skin care should be helping your skin, not destroying it. I battled eczema and skin allergies for years. My lotion, deodorant, laundry soap and lip balm soothe skin, heal small cuts and (along with an anti-inflammatory and chemical free diet) took away the eczema."
