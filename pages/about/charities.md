Every sale we consider it a privilege to join with our Consignors to donate to worthy causes in our community. Our {{ site.dates.season_year }} Sale recipient is [The Christian Sharing Center](http://thesharingcenter.org/). We love participating in their stated mission- "to provide essential resources to those in need while ensuring dignity, reflecting Christian generosity, and sharing God's love."

You can designate any item for donation by using a white tag. Consider donating all your items as a [White Tag Consignor]({% link pages/consignors/white-tag-consignors.md %}) (you get to shop an hour earlier than other Consignors)!

Thank you for participating with us and using your unsold items to bless others.
