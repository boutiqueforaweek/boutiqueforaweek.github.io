title: "Getting your baby to sleep and eat"
---

This is part two of our Baby Essentials series. [Part one]({% post_url 2012-07-30-transporting-your-baby %}) included what you need for transporting your darling little one! Today we'll discuss sleeping arrangements and feeding your little ones.

Sleeping Arrangements:

Crib. Pack n Play. Moses Basket. Bassinet. There are many options to consider when it comes to laying your precious bundle down to sleep. Some parents prefer the peace of mind and availability of keeping the baby close and in the bedroom during the first few weeks, making a pack n play or bassinet a convenient choice. Smaller than a crib, these items can fit easily next to your bed and usually don't require much in the way of room rearranging. While shopping for cribs these days, the sky is the limit when it comes to styles and colors, so a few minutes of online researching is beneficial here as well! One great way to help make this big purchase a bit more affordable is to choose a more basic crib and let your baby's bedding become the focal point in the nursery. Nothing like a cozy quilt or a fuzzy blanket to help bring just the right feel to your little one's nursery! Looking for big ticket items like cribs, pack n plays and toddler beds at BFAW can help to cut down on the cost when putting together your baby's new room. Don't forget to look into how you can shop early at the upcoming fall sale so you can be sure to find these must-have items for a fraction of what you'd pay retail.

Hungry Little Monsters:

Other than sleeping, soiling diapers and, of course, making you fall more in love with them every day, eating is sure to quickly become your baby's favorite hobby. Whether you've chosen to breastfeed or bottle feed, you'll want to check into the many accessories that are available. Everything from the best bottles and bottle warmers to which breast pump will provide the easiest and most discreet option - there are many choices! One of the best pieces of advice I've heard is to pick a mommy who's had a successful baby feeding career and ask their opinion. This can save you time and energy, and keep you from wanting to pull your hair out when it comes to searching for the best bottle/nipple/feeding selections available. Be careful though, too many opinions can oftentimes be more confusing than helpful! So choose wisely and rest assured, the science of feeding your little one isn't all that complicated. Be sure to have plenty of burp cloths and bibs on hand, because though they start out little, babies are pros at making big messes. The last items on the baby feeding checklist are highchairs and feeding accessories like plates, cups and baby friendly forks and spoons. While not immediately necessary for your newborn, before you know it, it will be time for your little one to experiment with solid foods and BFAW is a great place to find these items for a bargain.
