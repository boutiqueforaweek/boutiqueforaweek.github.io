The success of our previous Mom's Night Out events inspires us to keep bringing it back! We love spending Wednesday's extended shopping hours with you.

If you missed our previous Mom's Night Out, what you can expect this sale is a laid-back, kid-free evening filled with music and amazing giveaways. This special night provides something extra fun to your shopping experience, and is a great opportunity to bring and shop with your friends. (Please note: Kids ARE allowed at the event.)

Here's a shopper's experience from last sale:

_"I absolutely loved shopping during the Mom's Night Out at Boutique for a Week! There were tons of amazing giveaways, great deals on fantastic clothes and toys for my kids, and fun music and snacks too! I ended up getting several bags of stuff for around $100! I couldn't believe how many of my favorite brand name children's clothes that were available in a variety of sizes. And I even won a really great Thirty One bag and some new essential oils to try! I can't wait to shop at the next Mom's Night Out and snag some fun fall clothes for the kids."_

This sale's Mom's Night Out is shaping up to be even more fun than last. We have a bunch of exciting giveaways planned. Check the blog closer to the sale for more specifics.

Giveaway winners are chosen through a raffle. Entering the raffle is free. There are many opportunities to earn raffle tickets throughout the night, and we draw a winner roughly every 15 minutes. You must be present to win.

Review all the different ways to earn raffle tickets on our [Mom's Night Out page]({% link pages/shoppers/moms-night-out.md %}), and don't forget to [RSVP to the event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1199115756770490/) on Facebook. The page will show some of the great prizes you can win, and we'll keep listing them leading up to the big night.

We hope to see you there!
