No.

Clothing sold at our sale should only be gently used. When we find the stained item (and we do-we're always looking), it will be pulled from the rack and left unsorted at the end of the sale.

Though, before you decide not to tag it, you may be surprised how simple even a set in stain can be removed with little effort. Great stain removers include hydrogen peroxide with clear dawn, Tide-to-Go pens, Fels Naptha soap, and more. The internet is full of tips for how to get out all kinds of specific stains. Give some a try. We love to see you earn as much as possible!
