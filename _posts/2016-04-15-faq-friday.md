We have changed our Pick Up procedures!

**We can no longer guarantee a complete sort at the end of our sale.** (It's still our goal though!) Make sure you're prepared for the time commitment and responsibility of finding your unsold items. Plan to spend at least 20 minutes at Pick Up. For more specific details about our new procedures and why they changed, please read our [Pick Up directions]({% link pages/consignors/picking-up.md %}).

This sale, more than ever, Consignors are wondering:

The sale ends tonight. Your (hopefully few) unsold items will be ready for Pick Up tomorrow (April 16th) from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. Any items not claimed by 2:00 p.m. will be donated. We cannot offer exceptions; however, you can have a friend pick up your unsold merchandise as long as you [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) your Consignor number and the name of the person collecting your items.

If you decide you want to donate your items and skip Pick Up, please [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) now so we save the time of sorting your items. Remember that any items you tagged with white cardstock will be donated and will not be sorted.

Please follow this procedure when you arrive to Pick Up:

* Check in. You will receive your Consignor earnings check. (If you do not come to Pick Up, your check will be mailed.)
* Be assigned a Volunteer to assist you.
* Gather your items from the sales floor.
* Go to the check out table
* Get your items verified and head home.

**Please bring something to assist you in collecting your items (for example: a cardboard box, wagon, stroller, or husband).**
