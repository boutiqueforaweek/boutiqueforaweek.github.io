title: "Vendor Visit"

We love our Vendors and want you to see all the great products they offer! To motivate you to spend some of your shopping time with them, we've created a game.

At the sale, pick up a Vendor Visit card. It looks like this:

Take the time to visit at least 5 of our vendor tables and get your card initialed by each. Then fill out the back of your card:

Put your completed card into the big bowl on the checkout table, and you're entered to win. Simple and fun!

One winner will receive a gift basket valued at over $100. You get a sneak preview of our prize through your visiting as the basket is made up of a donation from each vendor. We're thrilled to offer these great prizes to a lucky winner.

The drawing will be held April 15, 2016 at 2:00 p.m. and the winner will be notified immediately. The gift basket must be picked up by 2:00 p.m. April 16, 2016.

We hope you'll play!
