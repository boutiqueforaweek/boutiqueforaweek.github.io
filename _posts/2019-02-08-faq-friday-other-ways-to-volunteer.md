![](/img/blog/FAQ_Fridays_volunteer.png) [Volunteering]({% link pages/volunteers/index.md %}) is worth the time and effort because it means getting to shop the great deals at Boutique For A Week [first]({% link pages/schedule/index.md %})! If you are unable to work any of our [classic Volunteer shifts]({% link pages/volunteers/opportunities.md %}), consider bartering for your hours. We have a variety of options that range from providing meals during volunteer shifts to passing out flyers before the sale. Read more about bartering [here]({% link pages/volunteers/bartering.md %}). We do still [have shifts open](https://www.mysalemanager.net/wrk_readonlyworkshifts.aspx?partnercode=BFAW) during the sale so [sign up](https://www.mysalemanager.net/wrk_mobworkerlogin.aspx)Â if you're able. And if you have any questions or bartering ideas, feel free to [contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
