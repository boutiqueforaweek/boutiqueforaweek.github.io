YES!!!

By the time the Volunteer, Consignor, and New Mom Pre-Sale dates are over the shopping floor is picked over. That's WHY we added Restocking Consignors. We still have hundreds of shoppers that come through for the [Public dates]({% link pages/schedule/index.md %}) and [Mom's Night Out]({% link pages/shoppers/moms-night-out.md %}) and we need a good offering of merchandise for them. You can and likely will make just as much as a Restocking Consignor as you would if you had started consigning two days prior.

If you're uncertain, please check out our [Restocking Consignor page]({% link pages/consignors/restocking-consignors.md %}) for more great reasons to consign. And always feel free to [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with questions. We love hearing from you!
