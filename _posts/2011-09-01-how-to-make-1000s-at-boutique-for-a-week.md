title: "Consignor Makes $1000+"
---

Boutique For A Week recently looked through our records and realized that we have several [consignors]({% link pages/consignors/index.md %}) who seem to have gotten ‘into a groove’ and figured out how to best use the Sale as a way to earn a lot of extra money. This is an interview we did about one of those amazing, ingenious, everyday moms! This mom made over $1,000 on our Spring, 2011 sale. Let’s hear what she has to say about how she did it.

Q: Where do you get the items you consign?

A: A lot has come from the stuff we had for my boys. My younger one is three now, so in the last couple sales I sold a lot of my “baby” stuff. I also enjoy going to garage sales and thrift shops looking for stuff my boys will need and while there pick up any good deals I see.

Q: How many items do you usually consign?

A: When I started consigning I had approximately 300 items and I have increased each sale by about 100 items. I will probably have close to 800 items on the upcoming sale.

Q: What would you say is your ‘best seller’?

A: I almost always sell 100% of my toys. This is followed closely by those essential baby items – baby monitors, crib bedding, bathtubs, bumbos, strollers, swings, high chairs, etc. as there are so many expecting moms that register to shop early. In the clothing category, boys clothes and trendy teenager clothes seem to sell really well.

Q: What is the average price of your clothing items?

A: Approximately $4.00.

Q: What percentage of your items sell?

A: I have sold as high as 60% of my items. On average though , I would say around 45-50%.

Q: What advice do you have for other consignors that might help them as they tag and price their items?

A: Keep ahead of it by taking advantage of Boutique for a Week’s online system which is now open to accept entry of items between sales. This is a wonderful feature! And also to be organized – have your supplies on hand such as card stock, hole puncher, zip ties, hangers, etc. There is nothing more frustrating than not having the stuff on hand that you need to get the job done when you are ready to do it.

Q: Have you participated in a lot of consignment sales and why do you like Boutique For A Week?

A: I have gone to many consignment sales but have only actually consigned with Boutique For A Week. I truly believe they are the best consignment sale out there. They appreciate their consignors, they are so helpful, they are good at getting the word out about their sale and they are always looking for ways to improve.

So, it seems that you really can do well by consigning with [Boutique For A Week](/). We LOVE our consignors to come with an attitude of wanting to make a lot of money and doing all they can to make that happen.

It’s not too late for YOU to make a lot of money. If you’re already a consignor, keep looking around to see what might be a great seller and branch out a bit, as our $1,000 consignor did. Keep looking for ways to increase your bottom line. After all, every family can do well by pocketing an extra $1,000! We look forward to sharing about our next $1,000 Consignor for the Fall 2011 Sale. If you’re not registered to consign, that would be your first step … [get registered]({% link pages/register.md %}), and start tagging & pricing. You have almost 3 full weeks to get it done!
