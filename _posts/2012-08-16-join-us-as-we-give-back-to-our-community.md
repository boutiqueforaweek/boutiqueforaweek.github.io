Have you heard about all the ways Boutique For A Week is [supporting our community]({% link pages/about/charities.md %})? Won't you join us in helping those in need. Check out three ways you can partner with us in supporting our local community.

#1 - Support Your Cause - You choose your cause, you shop, we give 10% of your purchase back to your cause. Your cause can be, youth groups, your Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts club, your local ministry, non-profits, etc. Just print this [form](/img/blog/Support-Your-Cause-Friday.pdf), fill it out and shop! It can't get any easier.

#2 - Sponsor a Child - [register to support a child](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGV3TkcyeWRpYmp6TWZIZmNiMzFYRUE6MQ) in our community, buy a few outfits, a book, a toy and a pair of shoes and we take care of the rest. Best part is, you get to shop early!

#3 - Unsold Consignor Items, designated for donation will be going to support the [Community Food and Outreach Center](http://communityfoodoutreach.org) in Orlando.Â 

Join with us now in giving back!
