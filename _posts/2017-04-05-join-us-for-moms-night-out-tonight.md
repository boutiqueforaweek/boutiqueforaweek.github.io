If you missed our previous Mom's Night Out events, what you can expect is a laid-back, kid-free evening filled with music and amazing giveaways. This special night provides something extra fun to your shopping experience, and is a great opportunity to bring and shop with your friends. (Please note: Kids ARE allowed at the event.)

Here's a shopper's experience from a previous sale:

_"I absolutely loved shopping during the Mom's Night Out at Boutique for a Week! There were tons of amazing giveaways, great deals on fantastic clothes and toys for my kids, and fun music and snacks too! I ended up getting several bags of stuff for around $100! I couldn't believe how many of my favorite brand name children's clothes that were available in a variety of sizes. And I even won a really great Thirty One bag and some new essential oils to try! I can't wait to shop at the next Mom's Night Out and snag some fun clothes for the kids."_

Giveaway winners are chosen through a raffle. Entering the raffle is free. There are many opportunities to earn raffle tickets throughout the night, and we draw a winner roughly every 15 minutes. You must be present to win.

Here's how to earn tickets:
