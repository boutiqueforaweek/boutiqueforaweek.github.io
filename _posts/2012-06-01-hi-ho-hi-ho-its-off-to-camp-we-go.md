Summer is upon us! Hasn't the year gone by so fast already? If you're looking for some fun camps for your children this summer be sureÂ to check these out.

1\. Vacation Bible School - these are great little camps, where your children learn and play at the same time :) My girls participated in one last year that was only $10 per child and they loved it! They still walk around the house singing the songs they learned last year. Click [here](http://zradio.org/events/vbs-connection/) to find out where VBS is coming to your area.

2\. [The Orlando Science Center](http://www.osc.org/index.php) has some fun full day camps! They even offer early drop of and late pick up for the same price. Click [here](http://www.osc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=28&Itemid=45) to see what summer camp your kids will enjoy.

3\. Even [Sea World](http://seaworld.org/adventure-camps/swf/index.htm) has summer camps. Sea World offers a "sleep over camp" where the children get to sleep up close to the animals. Plus they have day and week long camps.

I'm sure my kids would love any of these options! Which one do you think your children would like most?
