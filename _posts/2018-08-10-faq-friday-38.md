No.

Unfortunately it would be far too complicated and time consuming to do that! There are hundreds of Consignors at each sale and most sell clothes. To remove hangers at check-out and then be able to keep track of whose is whose... well, it's just not going to happen.

Remember, you will get a new hanger with each item of clothing you buy and that can help replenish your supply for next sale. Also, hangers can be found for cheap or even free.
