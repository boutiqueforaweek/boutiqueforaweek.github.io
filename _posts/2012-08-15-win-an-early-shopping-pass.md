title: "Win an Early Shopping Pass!"
---

Its my favorite time of the year, right before sale time. Why is it my favorite? Because I love giving away early shopping passes. Detailed below you'll find four ways to enter to win one of 10 Early Shopping Passes. Pick one or all three, its up to you!

**Option #1:** On our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/boutiqueforaweek), we have two photos. One says "I'm excited to shop at Boutique For A Week" the other says, "I'm consigning at Boutique For A Week". All you have to do is pick which one fits you best (or both if you are consigning and shopping) and tag yourself in the photo!

**Option #2:** Tweet one of the following phrases. You must include [@Boutique4aweek](https://www.twitter.com/boutique4aweek) to earn your entry. You may tweet, once per day.
