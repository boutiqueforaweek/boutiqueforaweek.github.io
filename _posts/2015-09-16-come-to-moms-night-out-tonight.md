One of our favorite events each sale is Mom's Night Out. It happens tonight, starting at 8:00 p.m.

If you haven't attended in the past you can expect a laid-back, kid-free evening filled with music and amazing giveaways. This special night provides something extra fun to your shopping experience and is a great opportunity to bring and shop with your friends. (Please note: Kids ARE allowed at the event.)

Tonight is shaping up to be even more fun-filled than the last Mom's Night Out. Some of our great giveaways include gift cards to restaurants (like Chick-fil-a and Tijuana Flats), pampering products (like NYR Organics, Jamberry, and a gift certificate to Rock Paper Scissors salon), and more! Giveaway winners are chosen through a raffle. Entering the raffle is free! There are many opportunities to earn raffle tickets throughout the night, and we draw a winner roughly every 15 minutes. You must be present to win.

Review all the different ways to earn raffle tickets on our [Mom's Night Out page]({% link pages/shoppers/moms-night-out.md %}). RSVP to the event on Facebook to see some of the great prizes you might win!
