Our recent changes to Pick Up continue this sale.

**We no longer guarantee a complete sort at the end of our sale.** (It's still our goal though!) Make sure you're prepared for the time commitment and responsibility of finding your unsold items. Plan to spend at least 30 minutes at Pick Up. For more specific details about our updated procedures and why they changed, please read ourÂ [Pick Up webpage]({% link pages/consignors/picking-up.md %}). Below you will find a quick run down.

Your (hopefully few) unsold items will be ready for Pick Up tomorrow (Saturday, April 8th) from 10:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. **Any items not claimed by 1:00 p.m. will be donated.** We cannot offer exceptions; however, you can have a friend pick up your unsold merchandise as long as you [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) your Consignor number and the name of the person collecting your items. Remember that any items you tagged with white cardstock will be donated and will not be sorted. **Due to safety issues, we cannot allow children on the sale's floor at Pick Up.**

Please follow this procedure when you arrive to Pick Up:

* Check in. You will receive your Consignor earning's check. (If you do not come to Pick Up, your check will be mailed.)
* Be assigned a Volunteer to assist you.
* Gather your items from the sales floor.
* Get your items verified.
* Leave!

**Please bring something to assist you in collecting your items (for example: a cardboard box, wagon, stroller, or husband).**
