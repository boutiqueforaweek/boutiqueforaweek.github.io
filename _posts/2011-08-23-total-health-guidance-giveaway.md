John and Theresa Stiteler of [Total Health Guidance](http://www.totalhealthguidance.com/) are giving away one Nutritional Assessment and/or Weight Loss Assessment which both include a Personalized Action Plan (a $100 value).

Nutritional counseling starts with an assessment of your health needs in regard to diet and exercise. I help people set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, & Time sensitive) health goals and teach simple and sustainable ways to maintain those goals throughout your lifetime. Many people try numerous diets, fitness programs, and nutritional supplements seeking better health. By seeing a nutritional counselor instead, you can save a lot of time and money by receiving specialized information to fit your personal everyday lifestyle.

Services are offered by appointment in their office or by phone. [Total Health Guidance](http://www.totalhealthguidance.com/) offers Personal Nutrition Counseling, Guaranteed Weight Loss Programs, In-Home Nutrition Assessments, Nutritional Program Guides for Athletes and seminars and workshops for small groups.

You can benefit from nutrition nutrition and education to increase energy, manage your weight, have a healthier lifestyle, make better food choices, sleep better, reduce symptoms of disease, regulate moods, strengthen your immune system and improve concentration.
