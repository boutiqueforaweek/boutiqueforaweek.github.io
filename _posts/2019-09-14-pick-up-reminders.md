Please review our Pick Up procedures so tomorrow runs smoothly. **We do not guarantee a complete sort at the end of our sale.** (It's still our goal though!) Make sure you're prepared for the time commitment and responsibility of finding your unsold items. Plan to spend at least 30 minutes at Pick Up. For more specific details about our procedures, read ourÂ [Pick Up page]({% link pages/consignors/picking-up.md %}). Below you will find a quick run down. Your (hopefully few) unsold items will be ready for Pick Up tomorrow (Saturday, September 14th) from 10:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. **Any items not claimed by 1:00 p.m. will be donated.** We cannot offer exceptions; however, you can have a friend pick up your unsold merchandise as long as you [email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) your Consignor number and the name of the person collecting your items. Remember that any items you tagged with white cardstock will be donated and will not be sorted. **Due to safety issues, we cannot allow children on the sale's floor at Pick Up.** Please follow this procedure when you arrive to Pick Up.

* Be assigned a Volunteer to assist you.
* Gather your items from the sales floor.
* Get your items verified.
* Check out and receive your Consignor earning's check. (If you do not come to Pick Up, your check will be mailed.)
* Leave!

**Please bring something to assist you in collecting your items (for example: a cardboard box, wagon, stroller, or husband).** If you want to print a list of your unsold inventory, you now can! First, log in:
