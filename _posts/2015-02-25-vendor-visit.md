We love our Vendors and want you to see all the great products they offer! To motivate you to spend some of your shopping time with them, we've created a game.

At the sale, pick up a Vendor Visit card. It looks like this:

Take the time to visit at least 5 of our vendor tables and get your card initialed by each. Then fill out the back of your card:

Put your completed card into the big bowl on the checkout table, and you're entered to win. Simple and fun!

One winner will receive a gift basket valued at over $100. You get a sneak preview of our prize through your visiting as the basket is made up of a donation from each vendor. We're thrilled to offer these great prizes to a lucky winner.

The drawing will be held March 6, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. and the winner will be notified immediately. The gift basket must be picked up by 1:00 p.m. March 7, 2015

We hope you'll play!
