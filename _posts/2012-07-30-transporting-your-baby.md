title: "Travel in style, Baby!"
---

Whether you're a minimalist or a baby gear aficionado, there is no getting around it. From the moment you see those two pink lines on your first positive pregnancy test (who knew a pair of parallel lines could be so cute!?) until you're waddling around packing your bag for the hospital, your mind is most likely reeling trying to make sure you're as prepared as can be for your new baby's arrival. While baby registries and online checklists can be helpful, they can also be overwhelming when you're trying to figure out what is necessity and what you can do without. So whether you're a first time mommy or a well-seasoned parent, we hope the next few posts will help you to narrow down the shopping list and get you excited about the savings and deals you can find at Boutique For a Week's fall sale.

Mommy + Daddy leave the house and head to the hospital. A few days later, Mommy + Daddy + Baby return home. Sound like the beginning of a confusing word problem? Save those pregnancy-sapped brain cells and let us simplify things for you. Car seat carriers, car seat attachments/bases and strollers are typically at the top of the "must-have" necessity list. While color, style and brand are all subject to your personal preference, doing a little pre-shopping homework can help you figure out what will best suit your families needs. Double strollers are helpful with siblings and multiples, or maybe a jogging stroller would better serve your active lifestyle. So grab a pen and paper and jot down some of the most important aspects of your babies travel gear and bring it with you to the fall sale. Whether you want the easy and portable convenience of an umbrella stroller or prefer to harness in your little ones and take a more heavy duty approach, Boutique for a Week will help get you and your baby where you need to go in style without breaking the bank.
