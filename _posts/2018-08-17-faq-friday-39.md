[Volunteering](/index.php?page_id=35) is worth the time and effort because it means getting to shop the great deals at Boutique For A Week [first](/events/)! If you are unable to work any of our [classic Volunteer shifts](/volunteers/volunteer-opportunities/), consider bartering for your hours. We have a variety of options that range from providing meals during volunteer shifts to passing out flyers before the sale.

Read more about bartering [here](/volunteers/bartering/). We do still [have shifts open](http://www.mysalemanager.net/wrk_readonlyworkshifts.aspx?partnercode=BFAW) during the sale so [sign up](http://www.mysalemanager.net/wrk_mobworkerlogin.aspx)Â if you're able. And if you have any questions or bartering ideas, feel free to [contact us](mailto:info@boutiqueforaweek.com).
