title: "The Holiday Sale Is Coming Up Soon"
---

Our first Holiday Sale is approaching quickly! This event is a smaller, shorter, and more specific sale.

**Smaller.** The focus is on toys, books, games, holiday outfits, winter clothes, and other items that make good gifts.

**Shorter.** The sale [spans only three days]({% link pages/schedule/index.md %}) (but includes Saturday shopping!).

**Specific.** Although we still plan to offer a large selection of items, the sale's goal is specific. We want you to shop for your holiday and winter needs.

For this sale to be successful, everyone needs to participate. We still need Consignors, Shoppers, and Volunteers!

**Consignors:** Think of the extra money you make from selling your items. Wouldn't that be a great supplement to your holiday budget?

**Shoppers:** Remember the great deals you normally get and imagine getting holiday gifts for those prices!

**Volunteers:** Consider the benefits of shopping early! The same apply to our Holiday Sale.

If you haven't put the sale on your [calendar]({% link pages/schedule/index.md %}) yet, do it! You won't want to miss it. And if you still need to sign up as a [Volunteer](https://www.mysalemanager.net/wrk_start.aspx?partnercode=BFAW) or [Consignor]({% link pages/register.md %}), don't hesitate. There are less spots and they are filling up fast.

We cannot wait to see you at the sale!
