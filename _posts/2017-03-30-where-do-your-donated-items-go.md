Every sale we consider it a privilege to join with our Consignors to donate to worthy causes in our community. Now we are expanding our donations abroad as well. For our Spring 2017 sale, we have two recipients of Consignor donations:

* Internationally, clothing and shoe donations go to orphanages in Haiti where there is great need for these items. Through [Faith & Love in Action](http://faithandloveinaction.org/about.htm) and [Aid International](http://aidinternationalinc.org/), these will be sent directly to the orphanages.
* Locally, the remaining donated items will go to [Teen Challenge SuperThrift Store](https://teenchallengesuperthrift.cc/)Â in Longwood. Teen Challenge is a program aimed at helping students in recovery from addiction. SuperThrift donates proceeds from store sales to provide job training, continuing education opportunities, and addiction recovery services.

We hope you are as excited as we are to contribute to these organizations!
