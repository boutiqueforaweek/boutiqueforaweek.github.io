The success of last sale's Mom's Night Out inspired us to bring the event back for our Spring Sale! We love spending Wednesday's extended shopping hours with you.

If you missed our previous Mom's Night Out, what you can expect this sale is a laid-back, kid-free evening filled with music and amazing giveaways. This special night provides something extra fun to your shopping experience, and is a great opportunity to bring and shop with your friends

This sale's Mom's Night Out is shaping up to be even more fun than last. We have a bunch of exciting giveaways planned including Magic tickets, earrings, and $50 of Chick-fil-a.

Giveaway winners are chosen through a raffle. Entering the raffle is free. There are many opportunities to earn raffle tickets throughout the night, and we draw a winner roughly every 15 minutes. You must be present to win.

Check out our [Mom's Night Out page]({% link pages/shoppers/moms-night-out.md %})Â for all the ways you can earn raffle tickets, and don't forget to [RSVP to the event](https://www.facebook.com/events/352370064946634/) on Facebook. The page already shows some of the great prizes you can win, and we'll continue listing them leading up to the big night.

We hope to see you there!
