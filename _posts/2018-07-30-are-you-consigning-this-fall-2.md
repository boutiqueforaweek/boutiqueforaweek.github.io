It can be overwhelming to decide the best way to earn money for your gently used children's items. Should you try Once Upon a Child or another store like it? Host a garage sale or even try a different consignment sale? What makes Boutique For A Week your go-to place to consign instead those other options? Plenty of reasons!

Boutique For A Week allows you the luxury of deciding your own price. Stores do not generally allow you to do that. You are either paid (a low price) for your item, or you have to wait until the item sells to collect your earnings. When the store pays you up front, what they offer is take it or leave it. If the store makes you wait until the item sells, it often takes months before you see that money! At Boutique For A Week you decide how much you want to earn for your item. At the end of sale week (barring equipment failure) you receive your earnings. The process is simple, plus you have much more control.

Another big reason to choose to consign with us: we love our Consignors and vice versa! Our sale has been repeatedly voted Best Children's Consignment Sale in Central Florida as a result. It's our goal to serve you and to see you succeed. 

We provide this blog and an entire website with the purpose of helping you navigate the consigning process, boost your sales, and more. If you're uncertain what it looks like to consign, check out some previous blog posts and site pages like ["Is It Worth It To Consign?"](/mom-to-mom-is-it-worth-it-to-consign-2/), "[Top Ten Reasons To Consign This Fall](/top-ten-reasons-to-consign-this-fall/)", [Consignors 101](/consignors/), and [Preparing Your Merchandise](/consignors/preparing-merchandise/) to get an idea of what consigning is like and get motivated to earn some extra money. It is our continual goal to serve you and your family in this way.
