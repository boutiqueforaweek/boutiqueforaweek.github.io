First of all, thank you for volunteering! Whether this your first or tenth volunteer shift, we really appreciate you giving us your time. Our sale cannot function without your help!

We expect a lot out of our Folunteers and are rarely disappointed! As a Volunteer, we want you to take initiative. If you see a Shopper in need of a new basket or an area of toys that is messy, we want you to be ready to fix those problems without being told.

We expect our Volunteers to be glad to be working their shifts and to share that happy attitude with our shoppers! You need to be willing to help in customer service type ways like passing out shopping baskets, carrying large items to the holding area, and helping to bring purchases out to cars.

You need to be prepared for some physical activity. At minimum, you will likely be on your feet the whole of your shift. If you signed up to volunteer during Drop Off or Sort, be ready for even more manual labor and the possibility of some lifting. If you're uncertain what is going on at the time you signed up for, check your email registration or our [event calendar]({% link pages/schedule/index.md %}). Please [let us know](mailto:info@boutiqueforaweek.com) if you have any physical limitations that might affect your abilities (like pregnancy) so we can be prepared.

We also expect a certain level of professionalism from our Volunteers like arriving on time, not shopping during your shift, not using your phone, and working your shift for the length of time scheduled. This also means your children are in the care of someone else and you have taken care of your own meal needs.

If you have any questions about volunteering, don't hesitate to [ask us](mailto:info@boutiqueforaweek.com) or review the extensive information on our website ([start here]({% link pages/volunteers/index.md %})).

There are still [volunteer shifts available](http://www.mysalemanager.net/wrk_readonlyworkshifts.aspx?partnercode=BFAW)Â if you're interested. Remember Volunteers shop first, so it's well worth your time!
