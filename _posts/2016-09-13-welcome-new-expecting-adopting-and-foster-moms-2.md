Today is our busiest shopping day and one of our favorite times. We love the opportunity to provide so many essential baby items to new, expecting, adopting, and foster moms. You'll get the best selection on port-a cribs, strollers, exersaucers, car seats, and anything else you need for your little one!

Please note, our sale has expanded into an additional room in the facility. Most of the larger baby items you are likely shopping for will be in the chapel. This includes strollers, cribs, car seats, exersaucers, and high chairs. Refer to the map below so you know where to look!

Your special Pre-Sale shopping time is today from 4:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. If you have pre-registered please be sure to bring your shopping pass with you (you received it in an email confirmation). This pass your access into the PreSale. If you do not have your shopping pass, you will be able to re-register at the door.

Hope to see you today!
