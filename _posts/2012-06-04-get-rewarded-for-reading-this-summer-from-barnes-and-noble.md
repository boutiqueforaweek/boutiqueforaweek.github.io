[Barnes and Noble has a neat summer reading incentive](https://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/our-stores-communities/summer-reading-program/). Your child will read 8 books and fill out a printable reading journal once the reading is complete.

Then head on down to your local Barnes and Noble where your child will be able to pick out a free book, there are a few books to choose from.

Even if they don't have books that your child may like, keep in mind books make great gifts.
