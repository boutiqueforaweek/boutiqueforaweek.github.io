[Barnes and Noble has a neat summer reading incentive](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/summer-reading/379003570). Your child will read 8 books and fill out a printable reading journal once the reading is complete.

Then head on down to your local Barnes and Noble where your child will be able to pick out a free book, there are a few books to choose from.

Even if they don't have books that your child may like, keep in mind books make great gifts. ![](/wp-content/plugins/wagit_editor/smiles/msn/teeth_smile.gif)
