YES!!!

By the time the Volunteer, Consignor, and New Mom Pre-Sale dates are over the shopping floor is picked over. That's WHY we added Restocking Consignors. We still have hundreds of shoppers that come through for the [Public dates](/events/) and [Mom's Night Out](/shoppers/moms-night-out/) and we need a good offering of merchandise for them. You can and likely will make just as much as a Restocking Consignor as you would if you had started consigning two days prior.

If you're uncertain, please check out our [Restocking Consignor page](/consignors/restocking-consignors/) for more great reasons to consign. And always feel free to [email us](mailto:info@boutiqueforaweek.com) with questions. We love hearing from you!
