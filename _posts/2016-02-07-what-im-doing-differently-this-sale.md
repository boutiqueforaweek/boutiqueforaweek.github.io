We want to take time this sale to provide ideas on how you can improve your experience._ _In today's post, a past (and present) Consignor shares her plans on how to get a head start on tagging for our Spring Sale._ _As any Consignor knows, most of the work of consigning happens before our sale even starts. We hope this helps you in your preparations!_

Every sale, I promise myself this will be the one.. the one where I am different. I'll go through my stuff sooner and enter it efficiently into my inventory. I'll check my supplies before I start trying to use them and only then realize I don't have enough hangers or zip ties or safety pins. I'll enter all my to-be-donated items in bulk so I can print them together instead of having to go through and re-read all the descriptions to know which ones to select.

I've done this exactly zero times.

I love Boutique For A Week. I enjoy volunteering, shopping, and consigning. The deals are wonderful and the money I earn consigning is always worth the effort I put into tagging. I just wish I was better about doing it all in a way that is less stressful to me. Each sale has taught me a lesson, but I want to finally put them all together. This sale is another chance for me to do that!

So what am I doing differently?

First, I am starting sooner. That means I have already started, but it would be just as true if I started only two weeks before the sale. I usually have a crazy week of tagging leading up to the Saturday night when item entry closes (FYI: Saturday, April 9th for the Spring 2016 Sale). Listen, that is a fine way to do things. Some people thrive under pressure or have less stuff to tag (and you can expect a blog post that week this sale to provide some last minute tips to motivate you through the mad dash at the end). I just want to avoid that this sale.

What does starting look like? For me, I sorted through ALL the clothes and pulled out what I plan on selling. I made a separate pile (so I don't have to check them all again) of items that need ironing or stain removal. I didn't make a separate donate pile because I plan to donate everything that doesn't sell at the end of the sale. (Check out info on [White Tag Consignors]({% link pages/consignors/white-tag-consignors.md %}) if you think you'll be doing the same). If you plan on only donating some items, I encourage you to separate them and save yourself the time later. By the end of February, I plan to have all my clothing items on hangers, entered, and tagged (and stashed in my garage).

This past week, I went through our playroom. We keep all our toys in only two places: the playroom and the baby's room. I went through the toys in the baby's room before Christmas and pulled out what I wanted to sell. The big kids' playroom was a bigger task. Side note: there is no toy as irresistible to your child as one in the sell pile (even if your child has NO clue that's what you're doing). I tried to do most of the work while my kids were asleep to avoid that issue. I have a stash of Boutique For A Week "to sell" stuff in my laundry room where those toys are hiding out until the sale.

I plan on tagging my toys and other non-clothing merchandise during Spring Break week in March. I still need to look through my house for remaining items to sell, using this [blog post](/ten-common-and-not-so-common-places-to-find-items-for-boutique-for-a-week/) as my guide. I want to be done looking through everything before I do my second (hopefully final) round of tagging.

How well I accomplish these goals remains to be seen. At least this time I have a plan. Even if I wait now, I'm already ahead.
