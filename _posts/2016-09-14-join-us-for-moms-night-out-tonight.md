The success of our previous Mom's Night Out events inspires us to keep bringing it back! We love spending Wednesday's extended shopping hours with you. Mom's Night Out is tonight, September 14th from 8:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. We are restocked and ready for you! 

We've planned lots of giveaways and will select winners several times per hour!!! (You must be present to win, limit one prize per person.) Get a sneak peek of our giveaway sponsors and select vendors by checking out our [Facebook Events page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1777413905877232/). Prizes include a free birthday party from O2BKids in Oviedo (valued at $250), a Chick-fil-a prize pack (worth $50), free passes to My Gym, Semoran Skateway, Rebounderz, and MORE!

If you missed our previous Mom's Night Out events, what you can expect is a laid-back, kid-free evening filled with music and amazing giveaways. This special night provides something extra fun to your shopping experience, and is a great opportunity to bring and shop with your friends. (Please note: Kids ARE allowed at the event.)

Here's a shopper's experience from a previous sale:

_"I absolutely loved shopping during the Mom's Night Out at Boutique for a Week! There were tons of amazing giveaways, great deals on fantastic clothes and toys for my kids, and fun music and snacks too! I ended up getting several bags of stuff for around $100! I couldn't believe how many of my favorite brand name children's clothes that were available in a variety of sizes. And I even won a really great Thirty One bag and some new essential oils to try! I can't wait to shop at the next Mom's Night Out and snag some fun fall clothes for the kids."_

Giveaway winners are chosen through a raffle. Entering the raffle is free. There are many opportunities to earn raffle tickets throughout the night, and we draw a winner roughly every 15 minutes. You must be present to win.

Review all the different ways to earn raffle tickets on our [Mom's Night Out page](/shoppers/moms-night-out/). We hope to see you there!
