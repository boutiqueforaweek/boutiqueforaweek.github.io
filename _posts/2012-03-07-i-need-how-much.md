title: "I need how much?"
---

If you were in my house on laundry day you’d hear some, if not all, of the following..."don’t put clean clothes in the dirty clothes basket”, followed by many “ugh, I hate laundry”, “how can three girls make so much laundry”, or “this little boy may go through more clothes than all three of those girls”.

A few months back, I went through the girls drawers and closets and pulled out the stuff that mom likes, but they never wear. I put all that right in the “SALE” bin in my laundry room. But in just a few short weeks I’m back to “ugh, so many clothes”.

My husband and I are on a constant endeavor to simplify our home...I like piles and he likes things; but we try to simplify as we go. Then my super organized sister calls and says, “Hey, how many t-shirts do you think I should keep for my daughter”. At first I’m thinking, “what, who thinks like that”. But then I am quickly taken to the thought, “now that is brilliant”. If I had a list like that I could go through the drawers and closets and I’d know exactly what I’d need to put on my list of things to buy at the upcoming Spring Sale.

So with a little research, we’ve found these handy lists. We thought we’d share them, we’re nice like that. :)

We recommend you make one bin for “Boutique For A Week” and one for “Donate/Giveaway”. Then armed with your lists you can tackle one child’s clothes at a time. Oh and go ahead and [register to consign](/register/) now, so you don’t have to keep those clothes until the Fall.

I like this list a lot, its from [Chromama](http://chromama.blogspot.com/2011/05/basic-clothing-checklist-for-kids-or.html). It seems to cover all the bases.
